SoFi is one of the few lenders who provide loans above $35k which commercial banks and credit unions typically cap a personal loan off @ $35k.\n\nIn June 2017, I applied for my first personal loan with SoFi in the amount of $50k and was not required to provide documentation such as pay stubs and stock options with my employer which made for quick approval and a smooth transition.\n\nMy credit at that time was very good with a score of 740+ and my debt to income ratio was fairly low. \nI was offered an interest rate of 9.69% for 5 years and a .25% Autopay deduction which brought my rate down to 9.49%.  \nIn my honest opinion, anything about 5% on any loan is considered high but understanding that this is a personal loan, interest rates will be higher even with very good credit.\n\nNow in November 2019, I applied for a 2nd personal loan with SoFi in the same amount of $50k.  This time however, I was required to provide pay stubs and stock option information from my employer while my income has gone up and my credit was stronger.\n\nI was offered an interest rate of 12.66% for 5 years and a .25% Autopay deduction which brought the rate down to 12.44%.\nI was extremely surprised and concerned that the rate for the same amount I had applied for 2 1/2  years ago had gone up almost 3%.\nMy credit score this 2nd time around was 730+ with more income and my debt to income ratio was fairly low.\n\nI consulted with SoFi on several occasions regarding the interest rate offered but could not get a hold of the reviewer who made that the decision on my application.  \nAfter several phone calls and 3 hours + of litigation, I was told the interest rate was increased because of my income not because of credit score or history.  \n\nI was in shock to hear that my rate was increased due to income when my income is higher since my last loan in 2017.  I was hoping for a very low interest rate since I am a returning customer in excellent standing.\n\nIn summary, before accepting the 12.69% offered by SoFi, I did some research by speaking with other lenders such as Credit Unions, Commercial Banks and P2P Lenders.\n\nThe information varied and the conclusion was that even with excellent credit (750+), the going rate on personal loans is between 10% - 12.75%.\n\nSoFi is a great company as they offer different types of loans but they require excellent credit in order to get the best rate or they will either decline or offer a very high rate in the process. \nEven with excellent credit, it seems very unlikely the lowest possible rate will be offered.\n  \nHowever, they are very vague in explaining their decision for changing offers on the fly and you have to continue to call and ask for callbacks from the reviews/underwriters of the loan.  \n\nThey now require documentation which can become a hassle to some especially when you feel that the loan you are applying for can be paid off with no problems.  \nInterest rates are not negotiable so you either accept their offer or decline it.\n\nLessons learned:\n- Even with very good to excellent credit, expect to receive a high interest rate\n- Perform research and compare rates with other lenders to confirm the offer being provided is fair\n- Prepare to be on the phone for a while trying to get a valid/justified explanation on why the interest offered was made even if you have a very good FICO score, low debt to income ratio and make good income\n\nWould I do business with SoFi again?\n- That all depends,  I hope I never have to take another personal loan from any lender but I would still consider SoFi\n\nMy opinion is based on my personal experience and hope it will help other individuals seeking a personal loan with SoFi having very good credit, good income and a low deb to income ratio.\n\nThanks!"",""stars"":4}
